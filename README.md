# Creating YouTube videos

Posting content to YouTube is a great way to engage with your audience and build a brand. It allows you to highlight your passion and expertise, while at the same time sharing your knowledge with your community. Fortunately, creating videos does not need to be a challenging process. There's a set of tools and techniques you can implement to create engaging content.

We are here to help you create the best content possible. We've put together a set of resources and tips on this site to help you get started. We are hosting a set of training events to introduce the tools and best practices, and help you gain the necessary skills.

## Content

The best technical content on YouTube is videos which are roughly 5-10 minutes in length, and focus on one topic. You can share a technique, explain a concept, or demonstrate an activity.

To help get you started, we've assembled a list of [quickstarts](quickstarts.md) for you to use. These quickstarts are designed to walk someone through the process of completing a common task, such as deploying an application or using AI. They are there for you to use as your script for videos.

When using a quickstart as the foundation for your video, include the links provided under each quickstart as the call to action in the description. This allows a viewer to learn more about the topic. Use [bitly](https://bitly.com) to create short links both for readability and discover how popular the links are for your viewers. Having an understanding of user engagement is important to deciding what content to create in the future.

### Content tip

Practice walking through the quickstart steps at least 3 times before recording the video. This will help you gain a little experience about the topic and demo. You will then have more confidence when presenting for real.

## Tooling

There are numerous tools available for creating and editing videos. If you feel comfortable using Camtasia, OBS Studio, or similar products, you are welcome to continue to use those. The tool with the lowest barrier to entry is [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/), a browser-based video editor. Clipchamp allows you to record your screen, camera and voice, edit the video, and export it as 1080P or even upload straight to YouTube, all through your browser.

### Tooling tip

It's not necessary to use special effects in your videos. Sometimes using these too much can detract from the message. They're best when used to enhance your content.

## Audio and video

Looking and sounding your best need not cost additional money or require special hardware. Oftentimes a couple of small changes to your space can generate large improvements.

Improving the light in the room you're using to record is the quickest way to increase video quality. Generally speaking, more light shining on you from the front means the camera has to work less to see you, leading to a better picture. This can be as simple as having a window in front of you, repositioning a lamp, or using a ring light (if you have one). The key is to ensure light is coming from one direction - in front or above you. A light source from behind you will lead to dark images as your camera won't be able to adjust.

While it may seem ironic, audio is more important than video when creating videos. If the viewer is having trouble hearing you they're not able to understand then information you're trying to convey. While your computer's built-in camera works for most purposes, the same is not true for the microphone. A built-in microphone is often low quality. Headphones typically have a better microphone, and are generally recommended over the laptop's mic.

### Audio tip

Another way to increase the audio quality is to limit the amount of sound bouncing in your room. If your voice is bouncing off the walls it can sound hollow. You can hang a sheet behind your computer as a way to reduce the effect.

## Engaging with the audience

Because there's no live audience when you're recording your video, you can feel a bit disconnected. However, you do still have an audience - your viewers!

It can also feel a little different for your audience to engage with you. They might not know how, or might forget. As a result, you should always ask for people to like the video, leave a comment, and subscribe. Let them know there are links in the description where they can find more information. While you might feel a little weird about asking, thinking it's common knowledge, it's something viewers very frequently forget to do. Increasing engagement on your videos is a great way to have your video discovered more frequently on YouTube.

### Engaging with the audience tips

Having a [catchphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase) or other standard introduction and closing line is a great way to create consistency in your videos. It also helps ensure you didn't forget to ask for engagement when closing out your video.

## Be yourself

Everyone looks to others for inspiration on the style they should use when presenting. But always remember it's not them on camera - it's you. You are the person your viewers want to see, and you should always be yourself. By highlighting your personality on camera you're allowing your audience to see you and to connect with you. Your voice will sound more authentic, which is what viewers want.

### Being yourself tips

It's common to feel a little weird when creating videos for the first time. But by being yourself you're freed from having to act or pretend to be someone you're not. This will mean both less work and better content.

## Managing mistakes

Invariably you will make little mistakes when recording a video. You might use the wrong word, click on the wrong thing, or type the wrong line of code. Everyone makes mistakes, and nobody expects you to be perfect.

If you make a small error which can be quickly corrected, make the correction and keep moving forward. For example, if you click on the wrong page, you can return to the page you were trying to navigate to and continue with your demo.

If it's a big mistake, one which will require a couple of minutes to repair, you can either restart the video from the beginning or use the editing tool to edit the mistake out. The decision generally comes down to how comfortable you feel with the video editor you're using.

### Managing mistakes tip

Most viewers actually like seeing little mistakes from the presenter. A presenter who makes mistakes becomes more relatable because everyone makes mistakes. Small mistakes can even become learning experiences for the viewer.
