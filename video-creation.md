# Creating a video

Creating YouTube videos is a great opportunity to share your knowledge with the world. They can support your communities by providing resources for learning new skills. And they can demonstrate to potential employers your experience.

To help you get started, we've provided a process you can follow to create and publish your videos. Building a short video should take less than a couple of hours, especially if you spend a bit of time preparing.

## Identify the topic

When creating a video, you are free to present on any topic you are interested in, as long as it's related to Microsoft or GitHub. This could include artificial intelligence, web development, Power Platform, or DevOps. You are also free to use the collection of [quickstarts provided](quickstarts.md) provided as the content for your video; you can walk the viewer through the steps as your video's demonstration.

You should always choose a topic you are interested in and have some experience with. This allows you to share both your first-hand knowledge and passion with your audience. It's difficult to fake excitement, so by presenting on an area you enjoy you'll naturally create better content. You'll also just have more fun!

## Preparing the presentation

No slides or other resources are required for the videos. If there is a particular concept you feel would work best as a slide or other exhibit then you are free to create one. The core of the video, however, should be the demo. Viewers will want to see what you are trying to convey, what you are doing, how they can perform the same steps.

To ensure your recording goes as smoothly as possible, walk through the steps of the demo at least once. If you are using a [quickstart](quickstarts.md), complete the quickstart. By performing the demo before you turn on the camera you'll gain confidence and ensure there are no mistakes other issues. The importance of practicing the demo at least once cannot be overstated.

> **IMPORTANT**

> After completing your practice make sure you delete and cleanup any resources you've created.

## Preparing your desktop

Once you are ready to record, take a few minutes to prepare your desktop and ensure everything is ready. In cooking, this is referred to as [mise en place](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), or roughly "everything in its place." The time you spend preparing will save you even more time and ensure a smoother recording process.

Start by preparing your computer:

- Close down any applications you won't be using.
- Set your desktop resolution to 1920*1080.
- Open any applications you'll be using.
- Login to any services you'll need.
- Increase the font size or otherwise zoom into any window you will be using. Typically you can do this by hitting **Ctl +** or **Cmd +**.

Then ensure your physical environment is ready:

- Close any windows and doors to limit the amount of background noise.
- Ensure you have adequate lighting and there is no light source behind you.
- Turn off anything which might cause a distraction, including your phone.

## Record your video

With everything prepared, it's time to record! You can use any recording tool you wish. [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/) is recommended as it has the lowest barrier to entry, and can run inside your browser. You can learn more about ClipChamp by reviewing the following videos:

- [Recording a video with Clipchamp](https://youtu.be/K2fkSP4oH9M)
- [Video editing](https://youtu.be/08BRlyLtyFI)
- [Add special effects](https://youtu.be/xn2bkLX36lI)
- [Exporting videos from Clipchamp](https://youtu.be/sxyFgQexEdk)

To ensure the best video:

- share your entire desktop instead of individual windows.
- include your camera if you feel comfortable as this allows the audience to better bond with you as a presenter.

Once you're ready, press record and start your presentation! Begin by introducing yourself and your topic. Your flow should generally have three sections: introduce your topic, teach your topic, review your topic.

### Introduce your topic

Spend 30 seconds to a minute explaining what you will be covering. You want to "hook" the viewer, a reason for them to keep watching. The best hook is sharing a problem the tech solves, how it can make the viewer's life easier, or a common scenario for using the tech. If you have personal experience with the tech you should absolutely share that at the beginning.

> **Sample:** Hi there! I'm Christopher Harrison, a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. I'm a web developer, and spend a lot of my time creating React applications. When it comes time to push a React app I've created to the cloud, I want something which makes the process as seamless as possible, which is why I find myself using Azure Static Web Apps. Azure Static Web Apps is a cloud hosting service which integrates with GitHub and will automatically deploy my code when I merge it into the main branch. Let's see how we can setup Azure Static Web Apps by walking through the process of creating a new repository on GitHub, configuring Azure, and deploying our project.

### Teach your topic

This is the bulk of the video. This is your demo. This is where you will walk through the steps to perform the operation. Complete the [quickstart](quickstarts.md) or the procedure to demonstrate the tech. This should be roughly 5 minutes.

> **Note**
>
> If you make a mistake or something goes wrong while recording you don't necessarily need to start over. If it's a simple mistake, or something which can be corrected quickly, you can highlight the mistake and correction and continue with your demo. For something which will take a bit longer, you can either clip the video as appropriate or consider starting over. If you do start over, ensure everything is cleaned up and ready to start from the beginning.

### Review your topic

Take about 15-30 seconds to highlight what you demonstrated and how it connects back to the hook you gave at the very beginning. Close with a "call to action", which is what the viewer can do to learn more or begin using the technology you demonstrated.

> **Sample:** What I really love about Azure Static Web Apps is it "meets me where I am." Since I'm already using GitHub, I don't need to incorporate additional tools. What we saw is how to create and configure Azure Static Web Apps for a new project. If you're interested in learning more, or creating your own websites, check out the links in the description.

## Edit your video

With the video created it's time to edit it and get it ready for publishing. Your videos **do not** need to have special effects. The key to creating a successful video is ensuring you've clearly explained the topic, which you did! The goal of editing is to remove any padding from the beginning and end, and potentially cutting out any mistakes or long running processes. You can refer to the [videos demonstrating how to use ClipChamp](#begin-the-recording) for information about video editing.

## Create your call to action links

Every video should have links in the description which provide more information about the technology. Because YouTube displays the full text of the URL, you should use a service like [bit.ly] to create shortened links. Each of the [quickstarts](quickstarts.md) provided contains a list of links you can add to your video descriptions.

## Publish your video to YouTube

It's time to share your video with the world! You can share your video directly through ClipChamp if you're using it, or through YouTube. You should provide both a clear title and description for your video, as well as the call to action links.

Titles should provide a clear understanding of what is covered in the video, and why the viewer should click on it. They should contain action verbs, and highlight areas of interest for potential viewers. For example:

- **Azure Static Web Apps** (Bad)
  - This title isn't overly clear. It's vague, doesn't explain what will be covered, and requires the viewer know what Azure Static Web Apps is.
- **Using Azure Static Web Apps to deploy a website** (Better)
  - While this is improved, it's rather passive. It starts with the technology being taught, again requiring some existing knowledge from the user. It also doesn't make it clear what type of website is being deployed, so there isn't a good connection with the viewer.
- **Deploy React apps to the cloud with Azure Static Web Apps** (Best)
  - Notice how this starts with a clear action verb of "Deploy", immediately followed by a technology many web developers know - React. This is a great hook already. The title continues by indicating apps will be deployed to the cloud, and finishes with the technology.

## Promote your video

Once it's published, let everyone know about it! Tweet about it. Share it with your various chat groups. And let the Cloud Advocates know about it so we can also promote it!
